* Adjust rdoc stylesheet to advertise inherited methods if possible
* Suggestion: Add ZipFile/ZipInputStream example that demonstrates extracting all entries.
* Suggestion: ZipFile#extract destination should default to "."
* Suggestion: ZipEntry should have extract(), get_input_stream() methods etc
* rename write to syswrite
* provide alias for write -> syswrite in ioextras.rb
* (is buffering used anywhere with write?)
* produce_input should take an optional buffer parameter.
* Inflater.sysread should pass the buffer to produce_input.
* Implement ZipFsDir.glob
* ZipFile.checkIntegrity method
* non-MSDOS permission attributes
